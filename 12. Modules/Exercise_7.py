"""
Give the Python interpreterâ€™s response to each of the following from a continuous interpreter session:

>>> s = "If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be crunchy, would it?"

>>> s.split()
 ['If', 'we', 'took', 'the', 'bones', 'out,', 'it', "wouldn't", 'be', 'crunchy,', 'would', 'it?']
>>> type(s.split())
 <class 'list'>
>>> s.split("o")
 ['If we t', '', 'k the b', 'nes ', 'ut, it w', "uldn't be crunchy, w", 'uld it?']
>>> s.split("i")
 ['If we took the bones out, ', "t wouldn't be crunchy, would ", 't?']
>>> "0".join(s.split("o"))
 "If we t00k the b0nes 0ut, it w0uldn't be crunchy, w0uld it?"

Be sure you understand why you get each result. Then apply what you have learned to fill in the body
of the function below using the split and join methods of str objects:

def myreplace(old, new, s):
    # Replace all occurrences of old with new in s.
    ...


test(myreplace(",", ";", "this, that, and some other thing") ==
                         "this; that; and some other thing")
test(myreplace(" ", "**",
                 "Words will now      be  separated by stars.") ==
                 "Words**will**now**be**separated**by**stars.")

If the last test would look like this:
test(myreplace(" ", "**",
                 "Words will now be separated by stars.") ==
                 "Words**will**now**be**separated**by**stars.")
the test would pass, thou I dont know how to pass the test with the given test.

Your solution should pass the tests.
