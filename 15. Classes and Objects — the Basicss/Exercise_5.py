"""
Given four points that fall on the circumference of a circle, find the midpoint of the circle.
When will this function fail?
Hint: You must know how to solve the geometry problem before you think of going anywhere near programming.
You cannot program a solution to a problem if you donâ€™t understand what you want the computer to do!
