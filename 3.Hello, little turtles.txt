1. Write a program that prints We like Python's turtles! 1000 times.


for i in range(1000):
    print("We like Python's turtles!")

Ats.: We like Python's turtles!
We like Python's turtles!
We like Python's turtles!
...


3. Write a program that uses a for loop to print
 One of the months of the year is January
 One of the months of the year is February


months = ["January", "February", "March", "May", "April", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
for i in months:
    year = "One of the months of the year is " + i
    print(year)

Ats.: One of the months of the year is January
One of the months of the year is February
One of the months of the year is March
One of the months of the year is May
One of the months of the year is April
One of the months of the year is June

5. Assume you have the assignment xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]


a. Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.

xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
for i in xs:
    print(i)

Ats.: 12
10
32
3
...


b. Write a loop that prints each number and its square on a new line.

xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
for i in xs:
    print(i, i**2)

Ats.: 12 144
10 100
32 1024
...


c. Write a loop that adds all the numbers from the list into a variable called total. 
You should set the total variable to have the value 0 before you start adding them up, 
and print the value in total after the loop has completed.


xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
total = 0
for i in xs:
    total = total + i
    print(f"Total: {total}")

Ats.: Total: 12
Total: 22
Total: 54
Total: 57
Total: 123
Total: 140
Total: 182
Total: 281
Total: 301		(I dont know how to get only the last item.)


d. Print the product of all the numbers in the list. (product means all multiplied together)


xs = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]
total = 1
for i in xs:
    total = total * i
    print(f"Total: {total}")

Ats.: Total: 12
Total: 120
Total: 3840
Total: 11520
Total: 760320
Total: 12925440
Total: 542868480
Total: 53743979520
Total: 1074879590400		(I dont know how to get only the last item.)



6. Use for loops to make a turtle draw these regular polygons (regular means all sides the same lengths, 
all angles the same):

a. An equilateral triangle
b. A square
c. A hexagon (six sides)
d. An octagon (eight sides)


a.

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("hotpink")
wn.title("Polygons")

triangle = turtle.Turtle()

for i in [0, 1, 2]:
    triangle.forward(80)
    triangle.left(120)

Ats.: An equilateral triangle


b.

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("hotpink")
wn.title("Polygons")

square = turtle.Turtle()

for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
    square.forward(90)
    square.left(90)

Ats.: Square


c. Hexagon

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("hotpink")
wn.title("Polygons")

hexagon= turtle.Turtle()

for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    hexagon.forward(60)
    hexagon.left(60)

Ats.: Hexagon


d. Octagon

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("hotpink")
wn.title("Polygons")

octagon = turtle.Turtle()

for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]:
    octagon.forward(45)
    octagon.left(45)

Ats.: Octagon



7. A drunk pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward, makes another random turn, 
takes another 100 steps, turns another random amount, etc. A social science student records the 
angle of each turn before the next 100 steps are taken. Her experimental data is 
[160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]. (Positive angles are counter-clockwise.) 
Use a turtle to draw the path taken by our drunk friend.


import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("hotpink")
wn.title("Polygons")

octagon = turtle.Turtle()

for angle in [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]:
    octagon.left(angle)
    octagon.forward(100)

wn.mainloop()

Ats.: You will see.



8. Enhance your program above to also tell us what the drunk pirate’s heading is after 
he has finished stumbling around. (Assume he begins at heading 0).


import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("hotpink")
wn.title("Polygons")

octagon = turtle.Turtle()

for angle in [160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86]:
    octagon.left(angle)
    octagon.forward(100)

# print("The Pirate's finall heading was", octagon.heading()) gives this parts answer before quiting the window.

wn.mainloop()

print("The Pirate's finall heading was", octagon.heading())

Ats.: You will see.



9. If you were going to draw a regular polygon with 18 sides, what angle would you need 
to turn the turtle at each corner?


import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("hotpink")
wn.title("Polygons")

octagon = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(18):
    octagon.forward(50)
    octagon.left(20)

# print("The Pirate's finall heading was", octagon.heading()) gives this parts answer before quiting the window.

wn.mainloop()

print("The Pirate's finall heading was", octagon.heading())

Ats.: 20 degrees



10. At the interactive prompt, anticipate what each of the following lines will do, and then record what happens. 
Score yourself, giving yourself one point for each one you anticipate correctly:


>>> import turtle
>>> wn = turtle.Screen()
>>> tess = turtle.Turtle()
>>> tess.right(90)
>>> tess.left(3600)
>>> tess.right(-90)
>>> tess.speed(10)
>>> tess.left(3600)
>>> tess.speed(0)
>>> tess.left(3645)
>>> tess.forward(-100)

Ats.: Only going to turn couple of times and then go by -100 forward



11. Write a program to draw a shape like this:

_images/star.png

Hints:

Try this on a piece of paper, moving and turning your cellphone as if it was a turtle. 
Watch how many complete rotations your cellphone makes before you complete the star. Since each full 
rotation is 360 degrees, you can figure out the total number of degrees that your phone was rotated through. 
If you divide that by 5, because there are five points to the star, you’ll know how many degrees to turn the 
turtle at each point.

You can hide a turtle behind its invisibility cloak if you don’t want it shown. 
It will still draw its lines if its pen is down. The method is invoked as tess.hideturtle() . 
To make the turtle visible again, use tess.showturtle() .


import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()

tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.hideturtle()

for i in range(5):
    tess.forward(50)
    tess.left(216)

wn.mainloop()

Ats.: Star, (216 degrees, becouse All angles need to add up to 180 degrees. 
so 180/5 points(sides)= 36. now since turtle is facing the opposite way we need to turn him 180 
degrees, minus the 36 degrees. so 144 degrees to the right. or if to the left, then 180+36=216.)



12. Write a program to draw a face of a clock that looks something like this:


import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("hotpink")
wn.title("Clock")

tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.pensize(2)
tess.shape("turtle")

tess.stamp()

for i in range(12):
    tess.penup()
    tess.forward(50)
    tess.pendown()
    tess.forward(20)
    tess.penup()
    tess.forward(20)
    tess.pendown()
    tess.stamp()
    tess.penup()
    tess.forward(-90)
    tess.left(30)
    tess.pendown()

wn.mainloop()

Ats.: Looks like in the example, but I think that you can make it, in diferent ways.



13. A sprite is a simple spider shaped thing with n legs coming out from a center point. 
The angle between each leg is 360/n degrees.

Write a program to draw a sprite where the number of legs is provided by the user.

      


import turtle

wn = turtle.Screen()

babbage = turtle.Turtle()
babbage.shape("triangle")

n = int(input("How many legs should this sprite have? "))
angle = 360/n

for i in range(n):
    #babbage.speed(0)       maximalus greitis
    babbage.speed(10)
    # draw the leg
    babbage.right(angle)
    babbage.forward(65)
    babbage.stamp()

    # go back to the middle and turn back around
    babbage.right(180)
    babbage.forward(65)
    babbage.right(180)

babbage.shape("circle")

wn.exitonclick()

Ats.: A spider with n legs. (Input window is under Turtel screen, I think its becouce turtle screen opens up 
on a diferent screen.
Input window is under turtle screen.)
